<h2>What is the DSCDC?</h2>
<p class="clear-max">
	<span>The Design Student Coalition of DC (DSCDC)</span> is an imagined community open to all students and recent grads interested in design, development, and related fields. It brings students together to share experiences, laugh together, make connections, and support each other as well at the DC community.

	<br><br>
	The event introduces the DSCDC group to the community and serves as a networking event for its new members. There will be ballot voting for topics of interest, and nominations for the board of directors (one representative from each school in the area).</p>

<h2 class="clear-max">The Offset Effect</h2>
<p>I love screen printing (see <a href="/sltm">Sleep Less & Travel More</a>), and the minute imperfections that result from it. For this set, I alluded to that traditional printmaking method, and magnified its flaws, instead, converting them into a design aesthetic. </p>

<h2>Printing On Transparencies</h2>
<p class="clear-max">
With the overprinted, overlapping effect of this set, incorporating transparencies seemed like a really fun addition. The invitation features a transparent sleeve to pull off before opening it (pictured below in the bottom-left corner). Printing these transparencies was its own unique adventure &mdash; pro tip: patience is your friend when drying these.
