	We went out in the wild &mdash; we watched human behavior, took notes, and discovered patterns. We surveyed over 100 people ages 18-52 to learn about their music and entertainment preferences, and a few conclusions were drawn:</p>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>73%</h2>
		<p>Listened to music for over 7 hours a week</p>
	</div>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>61%</h2>
		<p>Also used social media for at least that long.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="statistic">
		<h2>92%</h2>
		<p>Listen to music or audio on their phones during their commute</p>

<h2 class="center">Changing the Face of Music</h2>
<p class="center">This app provides an entirely <span>new creation process.</span> Artists provide music samples or graphics (t-shirt choices, band posters, etc.) to directly receive insight from fans. The entire process is driven by the power of communication, thus increasing the sample's popularity and 'amping it up' for release time. It's instant A/B testing &mdash; while making fans feel like a part of the band.</p>
<blockquote class="push center js-invert">It's all about collaboration & discovery.</blockquote>
<p class="center">We did a lot of collaboration on the wireframes. Sorting out the exact user flow of this app is what took the most planning and teamwork. We drew a lot of mobile experience principles Josh Clark's book, Tapworthy. While the wireframes were being sorted out, I simultaneously worked on high level interactions such as screen swiping and menu options with jQuery mobile.</p>

	<h2 class="half-l">Fun With Interactions!</h2>
	<p>Hands down my favorite part of this app are the interactions and little changes between states &mdash; essentially the animations. There is a lot going on here, so as I developed, I made lists:</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>Preference Configuration Form</li>
		<li>Rearranging Artist Animation</li>
		<li>Rearranging Artists with Drag</li>
		<li>Dragging the Medal to Vote</li>
		<li>Reading a drag and drop event</li>
		<li>Creating a change on the event</li>
		<li>Reading that all of the medals have been places</li>
		<li>Animating the rotator to the timing of the music</li>
		<li>Making music play and pause</li>
	</ul>
	<p> The lists went on and on... <br><br>

	Luckily, I discovered <span>pep.js</span>, a small jQuery plugin for kinetic dragging and dropping on mobile and desktop. It helped a lot of the draggables, including the medals and home screen &mdash; accounting for little touches like momentum and assisting in the snapping-to-div feature. So, thanks Brian Gonzalez!
