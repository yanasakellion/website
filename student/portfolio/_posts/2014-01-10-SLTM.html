	<h2>Una Goes to Europe</h2>
	<p>I wanted a way to really commemorate my time abroad, and combine all of the skills I learned while in art school in Florence. I ended up merging four creative outlets: serigraphy (screen printing), creative writing, photography, and book binding into one little package, titled after my <span>personal motto: Sleep Less & Travel More.</span>
	<br><br>

	The set features two books: One containing memoirs and photographs, the other containing physical trinkets, and also containing two screen prints. It is held together by a unpictured casing made of book cloth and thick paper.
	<br><br>

	This multifaceted project was a chance to physically craft(<span> I LOVE crafting things!</span>) and be fully immersed in creation.</p>

<blockquote>The book is filled with vignettes, poems, and letters about places I traveled, paired with photographs I took there.</blockquote>

		<h2 >Getting My Hands Dirty</h2>
		<p>Learning to screen print was an amazing experience I ended up really embracing. I learned a lot about registration, color separation, paper quality, and ink making. I got my hands dirty making the silk screens for this project (somehow managed keep the final prints clean!), printing on both etching paper and book cloth.</p>

		<h2>Beyond a Perfect Stitch</h2>
		<p>
			From stitching open-spine books to gluing hardcovers, I learned so much from studying book arts, and greatly improved my overall craft. Sleep Less & Travel More became my final creation, combining hard cover stitching with printed-on book cloth, covering a double-fold open spine.
			<br><br>
			I also created a companion book full of tickets, business cards, and brochures from places I adored. I used the same binding technique and Florentine decorative paper.

	<h2>A Wonderful Adventure</h2>
	<p>
		I kept a blog when I went abroad, but also began to write about the cities I visited and experiences I had in a more creative manner for this series. I wrote about very specific moments and impressions in the form of poems, vignettes, and letters.
